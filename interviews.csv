Mahbod Moghadam (Founder or Rap Genius & Everipedia),"How would you describe Rap Genius to someone who has never used it?
<br><br>
<a href=""http://rap.genius.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rap Genius</a> tells you the meaning of lyrics. That's the ""intro line"" I give - but really, Rap Genius is WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE! If you think about it, all of these sites - Rap Genius, Facebook, Instagram, whatever - are the same thing. They are all just blogs with different skins. You can use Rap Genius to give another level to your own artworks. The annotations need not be ""explanations"", they can be playful, they can be part of the art. Rap Genius is a hyperlayer of text, it is a three-dimensional blog! I start trippin when I think about it.. crazy site!
<br><br>
How did Rap Genius come about?
<br><br>
I was explaining <a href=""http://genius.com/1258"" target=""_blank"">this cam'ron line</a> to my cofounder <a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/tomlehman/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Lehman</a> and it inspired his bitch-ass to build the site. It was 100% his idea. I was the first person who started using the site obsessively tho - me and this kid <a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/arielschneller/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Schneller</a> who ended up going to law school and never really getting involved in the business. We were just doing it for fun! It was an art project.
<br><br>
When did you first realize that it could become a successful venture?
<br><br>
Our first press coverage was in New York Magazine - it was completely random! We don't even know how they found out about it. Applying to <a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/ycombinator/"" target=""_blank"">Y Combinator</a> put some hair on our chests. We got rejected the first time - the rejection turned our balls into steel. We decided to get hella dedicated. We were working on the site for 2 years before we got any money! Thug life.
<br><br>
Were there any significant roadblocks while creating the site?
<br><br>
Getting the artists to annotate their own lyrics was a challenge! It was frustrating because rappers would go do an interview with Elliot Wilson, who gets like maybe 1% of our traffic, but they would ignore us. But luckily <a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/robmarkman/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Markman</a>'s addition to the team seems to have solved that problem.
<br><br>
ELEVATE MORE
<br><br>
We already have YouTube and Vevo, is there room for an Elevate More?
<br><br>
YES! The music video is part of music now - it has turned music into opera. A site that focuses on showcasing the videos is necessary! 
<br><br>
How influential do you think a music video is in regards to the ultimate success of a song? 
<br><br>
It is crucial. MTV Jams was the only station that I watched in college - one of the coolest experiences was chillin with <a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/tumabasa/"" target=""_blank"">Tuma Basa</a>, the man who ran the channel. He is a rap bible!
<br><br>
EVERIPEDIA 
<br><br>
What is Everipedia?
<br><br>
<a href=""https://www.everipedia.com/"" target=""_blank"">Everipedia</a> is Wikipedia without the racism and sexism. Anyone can make a page about anything - it takes 5 seconds. Wikipedia is a pain in the ass to use, and the community uses the complexity to block women and minorities from using the site. 90% of Wikipedia users are young white males. Everipedia will never be like that - everyone is free to use it.  
<br><br>
What is the benefit of using Everipedia over others?
<br><br>
Try making a page on Wikipedia. (Good luck!) It's fucking impossible. Even if you do it, they will take it down in a week. Everipedia is as easy to use as Facebook - it is a lot of fun! You get recognition for making pages in terms of IQ points and badges - we will also be giving equity to our top contributors! Everipedia has ""verified accounts"" for celebrities - Snoop Dogg can add to his own page! - Wikipedia won't let him. Basically, everything that was wrong with Wikipedia, we fixed it. There are a lot of differences, but the biggest one is that we have eliminated the sexism and racism that poison Wikipedia. 6 of our top 10 traffic pages are people of color! This is not an accident - it is a result of Wikipedia's racism.
<br><br>
How are you planning to deal with false information?
<br><br>
We have community structure that is very similar to Rap Genius, which is to say, it is 100x more effective at eliminating abuse than Wikipedia is. Everipedia won't be perfect, but it will be much, much better than Wikipedia. And Wikipedia is one of the biggest sites in the world. 
<br><br>
Where do you see Everipedia in 5 years?
<br><br>
Honestly, I think it will be one of the biggest sites on the Internet. In 5 years it will be bigger than Wikipedia, it will be worth billions of dollars. And we are not greedy, we want to share the equity and the profits with those who dedicate themselves to building the site. FOLLOW ME! flesh of my flesh!

Chief Wakil,"With close to 400,000 followers on Vine, you have to wonder - who is Chief Wakil and why haven't you heard of him? Honestly, we hadn't heard of him either, but we're glad we found him cuz' this guy really does it all. He even has amazing music videos – a rarity among the sea of low-quality garbage out there.
<br><br>
Chief is an artist with a vision. The guy produced and mastered his entire album. That’s pretty darn impressive when most musicians these days can't even work their own mic’s. What makes and keeps him interesting is that Chief's constantly challenging himself and the listener. “Can you vibe to a song if it doesn’t have an 808? I just try to push the envelope every time I do something and challenging the listener is what I really think is missing in music these days.”
<br><br>	
	We had the pleasure of speaking with Chief over the phone and here’s what we found out:
<br><br>
	Mansa Wakili is half Nigerian and was born in Kansas City. While he was growing up, he would move around, sometimes to poor areas but also nicer neighborhoods,. “Everyone had there own levels of good and bad. I've seen a lot of different walks of life.” He was raised by a single mother, though his father was still very present. 
	Chief says it wasn't until his teenage years that he got serious about his passion. “My friend let me borrow the Eminem music he had. I didn't even know he was white at the time.” Eminem would prove to be a large influence. Wakil was easily drawn to his persona of being yourself, and claims it's the only true way to thrive. 
<br><br>
“Instead of being the white guy trying to be black he (Eminem) was just him.”
<br><br>
	Wakil put everything he had into his last effort, 2013's Little Giant Epic. Around that time he was he was also in the studio with big names like Rihanna and Chris Brown and working on songs for Kelly Rowland and Jaden Smith. And though you won't see his name in the credits he's still glad to have been a part of something on that level. 
	Since Little Giant, Wakil's been busy writing songs for film and TV and working on his new album. “I want to embrace a different side of me.” Though he hasn't honed in on a specific direction yet he knows he wants to stick to his roots so people can learn who Chief Wakil is and where he came from. He's still vulnerable about his last album but says he's more confident now going into this next effort. That confidence might come from his recent spotlight, opening for Aloe Black and obtaining a massive Vine following. He's even taken meetings for voice-over work, a childhood passion. 
	Videos have always been a driving force in Wakil's career which is why we're so eager to feature this dude. We can’t stop watching them! Chief is a firm believer that a good video can take a song to the next level. “The video can show you what you are trying to bring across on a song. There are some songs where I think, if I didn’t see the video on this song I wouldn’t be as in to the tune. 
<br><br>
“They're (videos) like that knock out punch. The last hit you need to knock that thing out.”
<br><br>
	Wakil says he can really see his movement growing and that it's something special. He wants to reach the top and shift culture. Affecting people's lives is maybe even more important to him than the music. If you watch any of his music videos it will become clear that Chief Wakil is not out of reach from the ranks of his heroes, Em and Tribe. Do yourself a favor and check him out on Elev8Tracks and then go buy his album on iTunes. You'll join the movement soon enough. Oh and did we mention that Wakil was just nominated for a Grammy for his work on the show EMPIRE’s soundtrack. Not to shabby, at all. ",2016-09-17 20:58:28.428146,"",Chief_Wakil_blog.jpg,4
