Chet Faker is a play on Chet Baker, a jazz legend that inspired the talented Nick Murphy to move into music.  We’re glad he did. With “Gold”, director Hiro Murai combined two things every sane person needs more of in their lives: rollerblades (maybe?) and goooood lookin’ girls (certainly).  Putting choreography on skates, at night, in one take is no easy task, but Gold makes it look easy.  Hiro made a name for himself in the video game directing several videos for Childish Gambino (Sober, Sweat Pants), Earl Sweatshirt (Chum), and Guetta (She Wolf).

I'm always looking for my next  caffeine fix, weather its coffee or a motivational video to get me through the day, and right now I think I can say I've finally found it. Ground Up, the hip-hop trio out of north Philly never seems to disappoint with their upbeat tempo and energy filled videos. The group   is made up of Alex Azar and Malcom Malakai who MC as well as their producer, Bij Lincolns. These up and comers are surely on the rise and their new single Let's Ride definitely reassures that. These guys know how to bring the party to the video screens of our PC's but be careful though, their videos can be addictive.

11,YQHsXMglC9A,2016-01-17 18:55:48,"At only 20 years old, Xavier Dolan directed his first film I KILLED MY MOTHER. From there he went on to direct MOMMY, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year. For those of you who don’t know Cannes is the Super Bowl of film festivals that takes place in France every year. Saying that Dolan has an eye for film would be an understatement. He is so particular about his work that when Netflix failed to display his award winning film on their streaming service in the correct aspect ratio he made sure they knew about it. He didn’t just ask them to change it, rather he wrote them a nasty aggravated letter that has since gone viral. He has a true passion, and his talent beams like the sun on a house made of mirrors. So with all his tenacity and raw skill for directing it is no wonder that Adele reached out to him to direct her video for HELLO off of her new album 25. The video of course has since gone viral beyond belief (currently at 914 million views) but we wanted you to know the man behind the beauty.

The scenes with Rich Homie Quan take place in Atlanta, so you must be thinking: “well they must have spent money flying there?” Nope, they didn’t. Lil Dicky was actually able to fly his crew out using some of the frequent flyer miles he had obtained from touring around. They even got sponsors to chip in, shout out to Venmo and Weedmaps.

Bassy goes to for his art. A true creative, Marc cites making music as necessary to his health and well-being as food, shelter, or sex. Marc's knack for penning honest, catchy, and heartfelt tunes has served him well for the past several years. The San Francisco-born and Los Angeles-based artist has made quite a name for himself, composing hits for the likes of Wiz Khalifa, 2 Chainz, Chris Brown, Allen Stone, and pop princess PIA MIA, founding the chart-topping pop group 2AM Club, and releasing an independent EP, Only the Poets, which was acclaimed by Billboard, Complex, and SPIN in 2014. However, it was in early 2015 when Marc truly honed his sound while working on music as a form of therapy while crashing at a friend’s pad in downtrodden East Hollywood. He sure has come a long way.

It has it’s fair share of bikini models but it’s much more about the bro love he has with his tight-knit crew.

Recently, to keep up the hype while working on his upcoming full length debut, he’s been posting some interesting cover songs on YouTube.    Like all of Jon’s covers, “Cry Me A River” is a completely new take on the original. With nothing but a loop pedal, guitar, and some beatboxing, the cover sounds like a full groovin’ band. The lyrics will be familiar to any 90s kid, but this might as well be a different song - melodic embellishments, soulful growls, smokey timbres, etc… Something we found interesting was that Jon filmed the entire thing by himself and then digitally edited it to look like he had a camera crew.
