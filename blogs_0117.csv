Chet Faker is a play on Chet Baker, a jazz legend that inspired the talented Nick Murphy to move into music.  We’re glad he did.With “Gold”, director Hiro Murai combined two things every sane person needs more of in their lives: rollerblades (maybe?) and goooood lookin’ girls (certainly).  Putting choreography on skates, at night, in one take is no easy task, but Gold makes it look easy.  Hiro made a name for himself in the video game directing several videos for Childish Gambino (Sober, Sweat Pants), Earl Sweatshirt (Chum), and Guetta (She Wolf).

I'm always looking for my next caffeine fix, weather its coffee or a motivational video to get me through the day, and right now I think I can say I've finally found it. Ground Up, the hip-hop trio out of north Philly never seems to disappoint with their upbeat tempo and energy filled videos. The group  is made up of Alex Azar and Malcom Malakai who MC as well as their producer, Bij Lincolns. These up and comers are surely on the rise and their new single Let's Ride definitely reassures that. These guys know how to bring the party to the video screens of our PC's but be careful though, their videos can be addictive. In addition you can find Ground Up all over this spring supporting vets Moosh and Twist' on a 21 city tour. They will be everywhere from SXSW to Atlanta all the way up to New York City and Canada, so enjoy the vid and from all of us at ELEVATE..Let's Ride w/ Ground Up.",http://www.groundupsounds.com/,Let's Ride,Ground Up,,StratagemPictures,13,erpGx3zf6uQ,1/9/16 0:00,Is MAC MILLER on the come back? He sure was hot back in 2013 but until he dropped is new album GO:OD AM back in September he had gone over a year without releasing much of anything. Now we’ve checked out the new album and have to admit that he definitely knocked it out of the park with this one and even (he’s pretty consistent with his videos) has some great video’s to go along with the tracks.

Their latest album THRILL OF THE ARTS is so funky you’ll find yourself playing it over and over again while weirdly never getting sick of their tunes. They truly are catchy and have one of the most unique and ‘indie’ video’s that our team has had the pleasure of watching. So check out some funk in their song CHRISTMAS IN LA featuring David T. Walker & Theo Katzman, for some post holiday reminiscing. ",,Christmas in L.A.,Vulfpeck,,,5,v__NaQ8xMLc,1/11/16,"Ohana Bam is one of the chosen few. The singularity became obvious as soon as he dropped his first singles. Before turning 20, Rolling Stone hailed the Chicago native as an “artists you need to know.” Complex described his debut video, “Sheriff,” as “the rare video that can spark an artist’s entire career.” So it did. Before releasing an official project, Ohana Bam became something of a phenomenon. It’s no surprise if you watch the video for “Sheriff,’ where the former football star kicks frenetic raps alongside a 40-swinging, Mr. Steal Your Girl police officer in a fat suit. Please check Ohana’s video (on the left) as well as an interview that we were able to get with him (link) that can be found on our “exclusive interviews” page. His other video’s can be found on our site as well.",,Sheriff,Ohana Bam,,,6,r2IuB9GPSE0,1/12/16,"Jared Pellerin AKA PELL has definitely made more than a splash in the Hip Hop world; in fact we would say that he has hit the scene like a tidal wave for an artists just 3 years into his career. In 2014 Pell dropped his debut Album, FLOATING WHILE DREAMING which he absolutely knocked out of the park. To date the album has been streamed online millions of times. To add to that Pell was on Spotify’s very short list of Predicted Music Stars of 2015. His new Album LIMBO is awesome and even has some really unique videos that we are excited to share. Check out his unique video’s and an exclusive interview with the young star right here on Elevate.",,Queso,Pell,,Tyer Yee,7,Mqbw7CUVWhM,1/13/16,20syl’s KOMODA video is hands down one of the most creative video’s we’ve seen since Passion Pit’s SLEEPY HEAD came out over 5 years ago. You may not know who 20syl is but the 36-year-old French producer sure has an eye for making his video’s pop.  With millions of streams and counting on his latest album MOTIFS II we’re hoping to see many more video’s like this one in the future. So keep your eye’s peeled for that and check out this sickly creative video. Enjoy!,,Kodama,20sly,,Mathieu Le Dude & 20syl,8,yvHYWD29ZNY,1/14/16,"Since the $ave Dat Money video was dropped back in September of 2015 it has seen over 20 million views and counting. Pretty impressive for a video shot for no money, which for today’s video’s standards seems just about impossible. But Lil Dicky and his crew not only pulled it off, they knocked it out of the freaking park. The cameras used to film this video were purchased and then returned after shooting. The scenes with Rich Homie Quan take place in Atlanta, so you must be thinking: “well they must have spent money flying there?” Nope, they didn’t. Lil Dicky was actually able to fly his crew out using some of the frequent flyer miles he had obtained from touring around. They even got sponsors to chip in, shout out to Venmo and Weedmaps. All in all this video featuring Fetty Wap and Rich Homie Quan truly exemplifies what it means to “$ave dat money” and we are happy to share it with you, for free, right here on Elevate.",,$ave Dat Money,Lil Dicky,,,9,YQHsXMglC9A,1/15/16,"At only 20 years old, Xavier Dolan directed his first film I KILLED MY MOTHER. From there he went on to direct MOMMY, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year. For those of you who don’t know Cannes is the Super Bowl of film festivals that takes place in France every year. Saying that Dolan has an eye for film would be an understatement. He is so particular about his work that when Netflix failed to display his award winning film on their streaming service in the correct aspect ratio he made sure they knew about it. He didn’t just ask them to change it, rather he wrote them a nasty aggravated letter that has since gone viral. He has a true passion, and his talent beams like the sun on a house made of mirrors. So with all his tenacity and raw skill for directing it is no wonder that Adele reached out to him to direct her video for HELLO off of her new album 25. The video of course has since gone viral beyond belief (currently at 914 million views) but we wanted you to know the man behind the beauty. Xavier Dolan, we cannot wait to see what you have in store for the world of film. In the meantime check out Adele’s video for HELLO.",,Hello,Adele,,Xavier Dolan,10,IwBS6QGsH_4,1/16/16,"“When I was 15, my girlfriend cheated on me, and from that moment, in this bizarre psychological twist, I wanted to be the most famous entertainer on Earth” – Will Smith. And so he did. This rapper, turned actor, turned superstar that hails from the streets of Philly has definitely played a role in some capacity in all of our lives. It is no wonder that his music video MIAMI is listed as one of the most expensive music videos of all time. At a reported production cost of 2 million dollars we know this one is worth watching. So hop into your DeLoreans because it is time to travel back in time, all the way to the year 1998, location: Miami, Florida.",,Miami,Will Smith,,Wayne Isham,
